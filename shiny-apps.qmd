# Understanding Shiny Apps

Shiny is an R package that allows you to build interactive web applications directly from R code. These apps can combine UI components and server logic, creating dashboards that respond to user inputs in real-time. In the AO1 dashboard, we used Shiny to filter patronage behavior by age and gender.

Shiny enables:
- Real-time data visualization
- Dynamic filtering and plotting
- User engagement without complex web dev skills

Itâ€™s especially useful in academic, healthcare, and marketing domains for presenting survey or behavioral data interactively.
