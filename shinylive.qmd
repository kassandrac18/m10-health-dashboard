# What is Shinylive?

Shinylive allows you to publish Shiny apps as serverless websites, meaning no backend is required. All R code is executed in the browser using WebAssembly.

## Pros
- No hosting/server costs
- Runs fully in the browser
- Easy to share (works with GitHub Pages, Quarto Pub)

## Cons
- Not ideal for apps with large data
- Packages using system calls (e.g., `curl`) wonâ€™t work
- Sensitive data cannot be protected in-browser

For AO1, this could be used if our app stays lightweight and doesn't require database calls or secure data storage.


-   Limited support for R packages that depend on system-level resources (e.g., `curl`)
-   Slower initial load time compared to server-backed apps

Overall, Shinylive is perfect for publicly sharing dashboards or apps when privacy and performance constraints are low.
